# How to set up a fresh Mac the way I like it

Here's a simple list of steps to set up a Mac the way I like it. My setup is pretty simple except for my very specific trackpad settings.

## Password Manager

- [ ] Install 1Password [here](https://1password.com/downloads/mac/)
- [ ] Set up 1Password using QR code from phone

## Settings

### Trackpad

- [ ] Enable Tap to Click
- [ ] Set Secondary Click to `Click in bottom right corner`
- [ ] Set Tracking Speed to Fast
- [ ] Enable three finger drag:
	- It's hidden in Accessibility > Pointer Control > Trackpad Speed

### Dock

- [ ] Disable `Show recent applications in Dock`

### Desktop

- [ ] Use stacks

### Menu Bar

- [ ] Get rid of keyboard icon
- [ ] Add volume icon (to be able to change output quickly)
- [ ] Show battery percentage

### Safari

- [ ] Enable developer tools
	- It's in Advanced > Show Develop Menu in Menu Bar

## Terminal

- [ ] Install Xcode CLI tools
	- `xcode-select --install`
- [ ] Install Homebrew
	- `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
- Set up zsh
	- [ ] Install zsh
		- `brew install zsh`
	- [ ] Install oh-my-zsh 
		- `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`

	- [ ] Set font in terminal to compatible font
	- [ ] Download .zshrc from the Password Manager
